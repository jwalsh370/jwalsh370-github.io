      <h3>The Secret Life of Complaint and Complacency.</h3>
      <small>Written By: Jahan <br> 12/16/2017</small>
        <p>There is a fine line connecting Complaint to Complacency. They depend on each other in order to survive. There has never been a successful Complaint, neither has Complacency ever managed to arrive. They live together, not exactly doing <em>nothing</em>, but never really involved in <em>something.</em></p>
        <p>Complaint knows the secret to saving the world. He could fix immigration without laying one brick. He knows the problem with tearing down monuments, and sees how concussed ball players and kneelers affect the game just the same.</p>
        <p>Complacency nods along. <em>Amen</em> and then <em>Amen</em> again. This country just isn’t the same. He remembers when working all day afforded an eventual reward. If he was in charge, free speech wouldn’t change. Seems like you get in trouble for just saying what you think.<strong> These days</strong>. Thats why he doesn’t speak out when he sees injustice, <em>not worth the trouble</em>. That’s why he didn’t vote, <em>just look at the corruption in the government</em>. </p>
        <p>Complaint gives a <em>Hell Yeah</em>, stomping his feet two times, riled up and ready to let loose the truth. He fires up the PC, the forums are calling. Time to troll some Twitter polls, and then check on the latest celebrity gossip.</p>
        <p>Complacency gets mad quick, look at all these dumb people making it rich--<em>because the internet</em>. </p>
        <p>Complaint likes to focus on her clothes, and how she’ll take it all off for Instagram gold. But before he goes he’ll like her pic, and even send a private message letting her know she’s <strong><em>thick</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>Complacency could have bought bitcoin in 2011, back then it would have cost him a month without french fries.</p>
        <p>Complaint shot him down. It’ll never be a worthwhile investment. Focus back on the prize, I’d like a  Hot-n-Spicy McChicken and make sure the fries are supersized.</p>
        <p>Complaint had talent.<br>Complacency told him-<em>the art don’t matter</em>.<br> They only want to take what you have, they’ll say its great up front and then turn around and laugh.<br> If you follow your dream you'll just end up looking-- <strong><em>dumb</em></strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Road: A Transition.</h3>
             <p>I recently moved from Oregon to Virginia. It signaled the end of an important period in my life and the start of an even greater journey. These photos are some of the many amazing memories I have made along the way. This is my look back at the highlights of 2017.</p>

        <h3>Metamorphosis: It's Changed.</h3>

          <p>I first heard <em>It’s Changed</em> in the snow. I had just finished a  night shift at work and was walking home. Portland is an interesting city, it is the first place I have ever lived where I can roam for hours at night and never see another person. The city holds a forgotten quiet. I could tell what kind of night I would have as thoughts came and went in my mind, I remember untangling headphones, turning on music to give me a different kind of warmth.</p>
          <p>I had recently begun an incredibly intense coding bootcamp. I was struggling internally with my ability to finish successfully. I had developed a severe case of imposter-syndrome. The spiral down was efficient and swift, a familiar ride. My mind willingly lept from feelings of inadequacy as a developer, to regret over life decisions that I had made too casually.
          </p>
          <p> I had walked like this before. The thoughts would come, and I would feel the most bottom rock beneath me, an unfilled throw away throne. I have never given in to the small voice that told me it was okay to settle.  I have heard the voice out, even allowed influences, but I have never quit. My thoughts would bounce from doubt to determination. I would imagine life after succeeding, using that to propel myself through towards the next day. It’s so clear now to see how my own thinking was what held me back. I would struggle just enough for it feel less hopeless, never really putting my all into it.</p>
          <p>I felt a pulse in my stomach. Without my knowing the music had transitioned into <em>It’s changed</em>. I became aware about one minute and twenty seconds in, just as the organ enters. It was like a slap from a friend, a call to reality. The melody echoed, “It has changed.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I was stunned in that moment. I reflected on all the same situations; my imposter syndrome, my feelings of hopelessness, my embarrassment at not having more to show. With the fog lifted I saw that I had changed. My thoughts, my demeanor, my love, my style, I was not who I perceived myself to be. The change had not come quickly, but if I searched it was there. I could see each decision in my life, and realized its value as I stood in that empty street. My fear was not a signal to give up, instead it was the clear blueprint for moving on. It was not some paradoxical question, it was simply the understanding that ones struggle and success can not be compared. There are no true metrics for personal growth. A mile can be a marathon or a sprint. The distance remains the same.

        <p>I have always been enamored with Space, and now thanks to a White House mandate, Nasa’s data is free, open for any one to use. As I practice retrieving and manipulating data through API(application program interface) calls, I thought it would be rewarding to play with the plethora of  information Nasa has to offer. This is only the beginning, their API's can tell you the distance of the nearest meteor and how likely it is to hit Earth, photos from the Mars rover, photo and video from satellites, and even the sounds of space. Clearly, we will see a turn from the styrofoam solar systems of yesterday's science fair projects. While commercial space travel may not be available during our lifetime, this data can provide a new learning experience that puts the resources of one of the greatest space programs in the world at our fingertips.</p>
